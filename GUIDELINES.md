# Guidelines

The following guidelines will be used for all PyData meetups and events

- It is the policy of NumFOCUS that each PyData meetup chapter needs to have a robust code of conduct with clear avenues indicating how to address an issue that may arise. The PyData Code of Conduct is the suggested model that we provide, with the understanding that it was written with the U.S. context in mind. Organizers are free to modify it or write their own code of conduct that best suits the needs of their particular community, but unique PyData meetup chapter codes of conduct are subject to approval by NumFOCUS. Please contact admin@pydata.org if youâ€™d like to use a unique Code of Conduct.
- Meetup organizers must list Executive Director Leah Silen as a point of contact (+1 512-222-5449; leah@numfocus.org) for any concerns arising related to violations of the Code of Conduct. You may additionally provide contact information of the meetup organizers for this purpose. 
- As part of our commitment to diversity, we strongly urge meetup organizers to include women and underrepresented minorities in the selection of invited speakers for your local events
- We encourage organizers to schedule meetings at least once a month.
- To ensure the success and sustainability of the meetup, we find it is best to have two or more co-organizers
- In the event that you need to step down as an organizer, we require you to make the PyData/NumFOCUS Meetup account a co-organizer prior to stepping down, inform NumFOCUS (admin@pydata.org), and request that you identify someone to take your place.
- NumFOCUS will pay the monthly cost of the Meetup website. By linking your meetup to the PyData network pro account, billing will be transferred to NumFOCUS. Keep in mind that Meetup still requires billing information from new organizers, but you will not be charged for the PyData meetup.
- Because NumFOCUS is paying the cost of the Meetup website, members may not be charged a membership fee or any entry fee for events without prior written approval from NumFOCUS.
